We should be able to upload files directly here fairly easily. We can use different rscript files so that we can work on our own easier, but make sure after you're done working for the day that you upload it here. We can also work on a google slide so that we can upload things as we go. 

Make sure that when you make changes, that it is in this folder, since I use this repository as my r directory. Also make sure that when you commit changes, that you commit to master instead of making a pull request. The difference is that with a pull request, I'd have to approve it everytime, but when you commit to master the changes are there automatically. 

Use this as our PPT:

Your goal is to present your EDA (Answers to Questions 1,3,4,5,6,7).

1. How many breweries are present in each state?

3. Address the missing values in each column.

4. Compute the median alcohol content and international bitterness unit for each
state. Plot a bar chart to compare.

5. Which state has the maximum alcoholic (ABV) beer? Which state has the most
bitter (IBU) beer?

6. Comment on the summary statistics and distribution of the ABV variable.

7. Is there an apparent relationship between the bitterness of the beer and its
alcoholic content? Draw a scatter plot. Make your best judgment of a relationship
and EXPLAIN your answer.

You can take 1,4,6 and I can take 3,5,7.

We should also talk about how we should address the missing values, but we can figure that out at the end IMO.
